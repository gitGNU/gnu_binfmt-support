binfmt-support 2.1.2
====================

Stop hardcoding Debian defaults for various directories.

Ensure all necessary directories exist after installation.

Embed full path to update-binfmts into the sample sysvinit script and the
Upstart job file (the systemd unit file already did this), to save a path
lookup.

Add OpenRC support.

Add mutually-exclusive --enable-sysvinit and --enable-openrc configure
options, which cause the sysvinit or OpenRC script respectively to be
installed to $sysconfdir/init.d/binfmt-support.

binfmt-support 2.1.0 (29 December 2013)
