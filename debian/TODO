TODO list for binfmt-support; feel free to send patches. :)

  * Support internationalization.

  * The kernel outputs some junk to the syslog while disabling:

      remove_proc_entry: binfmt_misc/javawrapper busy, count=1
      de_put: deferred delete of javawrapper

    This is binfmt_misc's fault, not mine. Nevertheless, it should be fixed,
    especially as it has a nasty habit of ending up on the console if klogd
    has crashed.

  * Some checks to prevent silly things happening accidentally.

  * Hurd support.

  * Allow packages to put entries in /usr/share/binfmts to avoid "what
    happens if binfmt-support isn't installed?" questions - 'update-binfmts'
    on its own would add everything in that directory.
